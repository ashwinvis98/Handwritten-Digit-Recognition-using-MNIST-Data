# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-MNIST-Data

The project presents the well-known problem of MNIST handwritten digit classification. For the purpose of this tutorial, I will use Support Vector Machine (SVM) the algorithm with raw pixel features. The solution is written in R with use of e1071 easy to use machine learning library.










Implementation of Support Vector Machine (with Radial Basis Function Kernel) in handwritten digit classification. Trained a Support Vector Machine using a Radial Basis Function Kernel to classify the digits in the dataset. The parameter ’C’ of the kernel was selected using model selection procedure.
