# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-MNIST-Data
Implementation of Support Vector Machine (with Radial Basis Function Kernel) in handwritten digit classification. Trained a Support Vector Machine using a Radial Basis Function Kernel to classify the digits in the dataset. The parameter ’C’ of the kernel was selected using model selection procedure.
